# Polygon Flox

The Flox repository is intended to provide a solid baseline for starting new projects; it is meant to provide a full-stack, basic setup of all relevant services.
It includes Terraform files for setting up the related AWS infrastructure, as well as a basic Backend, Frontend, Database, and preconfigured connections between them. Some basic examples for operations and components are included as well.

All information related to developing projects with Flox is covered in the [Wiki](https://github.com/polygon-software/flox/wiki).

For developers, it makes sense to read through the wiki in its entirety before working with this repository. For PMs working with Flox, reading about the [Flox Workflow](https://github.com/polygon-software/flox/wiki/1_Flox-Workflow) is probably the most important part in understanding Flox projects.
